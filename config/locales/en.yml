  abouttext: "<em>So what is the SAMM Self Assessment tool?</em><br /><br />The SAMM Self Assessment tool is an implementation of the <a href='http://www.opensamm.org' target='_blank'>OpenSAMM</a> process wrapped together into a little Rails application. Its aim is to simplify the measurement of your organisation against <a href='http://www.opensamm.org' target='_bank'>OpenSAMM</a>, and to assist in the construction of a roadmap, and subsequent tracking of progress down that roadmap.<br /><br /><br /><em>Why would you build this?</em><br /><br />Well, simply put, we think that OpenSAMM is a great process to help organisations measure the maturity of security within their software development lifecycle. Plus, we wanted something lightweight that could be stood up on a standalone desktop (with Rails), or even hosted on the Internet (Heroku/EC2/etc)<br /><br /><br /><em>Okay, so why would I measure software security maturity?</em><br /><br />Without this measurement trying to improve the state of security within your software development lifecycle is going to be difficult. As they say: You can't manage what you can't measure.<br /><br /><br /><em>Asterisk Security Toolkit</em><br /><br />Asterisk like building tools to help security professionals out. The <a href='http://asterisklabs.github.io/'>Asterisk Security Toolkit</a> is our collection of tools, all of which are available on our <a href='https://github.com/AsteriskLabs'>GitHub</a>.<br /><br /><br /><em>Questions?</em><br /><br />Feel free to ping us: <a href='https://twitter.com/asteriskinfosec'>@asteriskinfosec</a><br /><a href='http://labs.asteriskinfosec.com.au'>Asterisk Labs</a><br /><a href='http://www.asteriskinfosec.com.au'>www.asteriskinfosec.com.au</a><br /><a href='https://github.com/AsteriskLabs/ssa/issues'>GitHub Issues</a>"
